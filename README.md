### Why
Originally, Dog-a-Day was a Christmas present for my dad that sent him a cute picture of a puppy every morning.  However, I figured while I was doing this, I might as well add other people, which turned into a full subscription based service.

### Services
* View all previously sent Dog-a-Day images
* Subscribe, or sign up others
* MailChimp integration for tracking of opens, and easy automated sending
* Backend for easily adding images, and pointing out possible duplicates

### Still To Do
* Flesh out backend for customized images
* Reorganize viewing past images to make it easier
* Monetize/add image sources

* HTML
